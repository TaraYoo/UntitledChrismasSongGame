## Game Reference
### Game Taxonomy
??????????????

### Player Immersion
Strategy, tactical

### Reference
#### MVP version
The AI's view scope (whether or not a manager or customer can spot you) could follow the stealth mechanics in the monkey trailer section of Eastward
The player needs to balance two status bars over a set time per game level (similar to Stardew Valley)
- a sanity rating (goes down while the music is playing), 
- and an employability rating (goes down when the manager or when customers catch you turning off the music or sneaking around)
#### Beyond MVP
- Once we have a finalized MVP of *just* the gameplay, I'd like to incorporate more story that ties each day to the next and some basic
resource management with a story and vibe similar to Papers, Please
- Having environment management puzzles, such as disrupting a product layout, etc, to distract managers and customers like the Untitled Goose Game might also be fun

#### Modes

#### Game Elements
??????
#### Game Levels
MVP should have 2 levels with 2 different type of department store layouts and speakers
#### Player's Controls

##### MVP
Moving around the store corridors, hiding behind displays and signs, and clicking the speakers to stop the music

##### Beyond
1. Manipulating the environment to lay down distractions down the line. Potential examples below
- player sees a customer looking for help, they could block off a corridor to coax the customer to run into the manager, who'd have to help them
- player messes up the display, making the manager need to go off to find someone to clean it up
- player sees a customer holding bread, looking confused, they could put down associated stuff like jam in the customer's way in case the customer 
had been looking for jam. The customer, once they have what they wanted, would leave
2. Mini puzzle to break the speaker -- player could make a tradeoff to spend more time solving a puzzle to break the speaker rather than just turning it off.
Having a higher breakage point would put the speaker out of commission for longer, but they'd open themselves up to higher chance of getting caught

#### Winning
Player does not lose all their employability rating and sanity rating at the end of the level
#### Losing
1. Player loses all their sanity rating, in which case, they'd do something erratic and get firedL
  - This could be a mini game by itself.
  Running out of sanity rating because the music was on too long switches the game over to a doom spoof where the player goes around crushing the speakers
  as quickly as possible while evading security)
2. Player loses all their employability rating by getting caught turning the speakers off or avoiding customers then gets fired
#### End
MVP: game ends after 2 levels
Beyond: Union? Becomes the manager? 
#### Why is this fun?
TBD
